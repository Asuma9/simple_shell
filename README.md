# 0x16. C - Simple Shell

## Introduction

Paul Asuma and Desmond Karani are collaboratively working on creating a simple shell as part of the challenge provided by Julien Barbier. This project aims to deep dive into the mechanics of shell operations, process control, system calls, and other core OS principles.

## Deadlines and Timelines

- **Start Date**: October 4, 2023, 6:00 AM
- **End Date**: October 18, 2023, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release**: October 17, 2023, 3:07 AM

## Learning Goals

Upon completion, we aim to understand:
- The history of the Unix OS and its pioneers.
- Fundamentals of shell operations.
- Concepts of pid, ppid, and manipulating the process environment.
- Differences between functions and system calls.
- Process creation and management.
- Usage of the PATH in shell operations.
- Essentials of EOF.

## Plagiarism Warning

Our objective is to fully grasp the knowledge from this project. Thus, copying and pasting from external sources or publishing the project contents is strictly forbidden. Let's ensure all work is original to maximize our learning.

## Requirements

### Coding and Compilation

1. **Editors Allowed**: vi, vim, emacs.
2. **Compilation**: 
   ```
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
   ```
3. **Coding Style**: Betty style.
4. **File Endings**: Ensure all files end with a newline.
5. **Function Limit**: Maximum of 5 functions per file.
6. **Memory Management**: No memory leaks allowed.
7. **System Calls**: Use only when absolutely necessary.

### Documentation

1. A `README.md` is mandatory, detailing our project's specifics.
2. An `AUTHORS` file at the project's root, listing both of our names as contributors.

### GitHub

Remember to collaborate within a single repository to avoid confusion and potential grading issues.

## Testing

Our shell should function seamlessly in both interactive and non-interactive modes. Ensure consistent error messaging in line with the provided `sh` examples.

## Allowed Functions

For this project, a curated list of functions and system calls is provided. Let's only use functions from this list to ensure we are adhering to project guidelines.

## Wrap-up

Once we've finished implementing the shell, we'll need to test it thoroughly, especially before the Checker's release. Collaborative class-wide testing is encouraged to ensure robustness.
